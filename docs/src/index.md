# BiodiversityObservationNetworks.jl

The purpose of this package is to provide a high-level, extensible, modular
interface to the selection of sampling point for biodiversity processes in
space. It is based around a collection of types representing point selection
algorithms, used to select the most informative sampling points based on raster
data. Specifically, many algorithms work from a layer indicating *entropy* of a
model based prediction at each location.

!!! warning "This package is in development"
    The `BiodiversityObservationNetworks.jl` package is currently under development. The API is not expected to change a lot, but it may change in order to facilitate the integration of new features.
